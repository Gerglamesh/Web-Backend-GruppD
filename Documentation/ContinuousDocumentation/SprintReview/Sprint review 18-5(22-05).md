  * Mirko
* Did all issues get done?
  * Yes, everything important
* Issues not finished
  * TRAPI-252(Code clean-up) There was no time



Comments about the sprint?

* Some issues took a lot of time, but at least we got them done in the sprint
* The newcomers in the team worked good and immediately understood the project
* We had a lot of class this week and it was Kristi Himmelsf√§rd(Christ goes to heaven!!!) so we didn't have so much time to work.
