//We have decided that get requests for country information and TravelRestriction is not necessary

//Unfinished issues placed in backlog

// Generally Issues was completed before our time estimate

// improve our performance during stand-up, needs to take less time, it's gotten better but still needs a little tweaking

//When we think of something that need to be added we add it to the back log immediately

//Generally we feel that we've gotten a lot done and that our project is well on track.
